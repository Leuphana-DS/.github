## Introduction - what is this organization about? 🙋‍♀️
This is the GitHub Organization for all study related projects related to the **Management & Data Science** master program at the Leuphana University in Lüneburg.
This includes smaller individual projects as well as larger group projects in the context of seminars or lectures.

## Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved? 🌈
To become a member of the organization, just send us a short message via mail or reach out to us on the Leuphana Campus in person. 
Depending on how you want to contribute to the organization, you will be allocated a certain role (e.g. for administration or coding).
If required, we can create a blank repository for your project and add you as contributor - just shoot us a message and let us know what you need!
If you already finished a decent project and want it presented here, we can create a fork to make your code visible within the organization itself.

## Useful resources - is there anything else the community should know? 👩‍💻
Please be aware that all the code published here is written by students of the master program and we therefore cannot guarantee for it to work properly.
All implementations that have been created, e.g. in the context of certain seminars, may contain errors and are not to be regarded as sample solutions by the teachers!
